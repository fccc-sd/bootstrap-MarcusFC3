                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        I, Marcus Jones Jr., was born in Central Michigan
                        on <strong>February 4th of 2007.</strong> I lived in Michigan
                        for the majority of my life until my family moved down
                        to Northwest Ohio to live closer to my grandparents. I have lived in Defiance Ohio for over 5
                        years
                        now,
                        attending Tinora Middle School and High School. My junior year, I transferred to Four County
                        Career
                        Center
                        to
                        pursue my interest in computer programming and get a headstart on college.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Attain a degree in computer programming</li>
                            <li>Get a job that involves programming</li>
                            <li>Purchase my own home/property</li>

                    <p>
                        I plan to attain an associate's degree in computer programming from
                        <span id="nscc"><a href="https://northweststate.edu/">Northwest State Community
                                College</a></span>
                        after graduating from Four County. Jobs in information and technology have a high salary average
                        and
                        so far
                        I really
                        enjoy everything about programming that I have learned at Four County so I would be quite
                        excited to
                        get any
                        job that uses my degree.
                        I would like to own a house because I have never lived on non-rented
                        property and I think it would be nice to have a place
                        to stay that is truly my own.<br>
