                    <h3>Fitness</h3>
                    <p>
                        While I can say that while fitness has positively
                        impacted almost every part of my life, It was very difficult to start.
                        I've found that fitness gives me plenty of intangible benefits upon consistent performance like
                        higher
                        levels of confidence and just
                        feeling satisfied with myself overall. I also found that fitness can be made into something
                        enjoyable
                        instead of monotonously performing exercises and seeing the challenge as a downside, measuring
                        my
                        progress
                        and striving to break my own records gives my workouts a sense of purpose that motivates me.

                    <h3>Sports</h3>
                    <p>
                        My top 3 sports are basketball, baseball, and football.
                        Because I'm from Michigan, I'm always rooting for Detroit in every sport.
                        Currently I am excited to watch the Detroit lions during the 2023-2024 NFL season because they
                        may
                        actually have a shot at a deep playoff run this year. I don't watch too much baseball because it
                        isn't
                        as fun to watch as other sports but going to baseball games in person and playing baseball are
                        both
                        really
                        fun.
                        Basketball might be my favorite sport of the three because I have played and watched it for the
                        longest.
                        While I always want detroit to win whenever I'm watching, I don't really follow a single team
                        when
                        watching
                        basketball.
                        The only sport I have ever officially participated in was
                        track and field at Tinora High School as a long distance runner and while I did enjoy my time on
                        the
                        team, I
                        prefer to run alone.
