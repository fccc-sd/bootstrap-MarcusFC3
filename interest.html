					<h3>Video Games</h3>
					<p>
						Video Games have been a huge part of my life since early childhood and I think they have had a
						large
						influence on my personality.
						I enjoy almost every kind of game from platformers to shooters to rpgs.
						Video games capture my attention through competition and/or fantasy. I find it really
						enjoyable to experiment with unorthodox strategies and climb my way up leaderboards in
						competitive
						games or
						take part in a fictional story when playing something more laid back.
						I would like to make my own indie game at some point in my life.
						I want to create either a 3d parkour game that contains a momentum based movement system and
						strategic melee
						combat or a 2d pixel art
						rougelike platformer.

					<h3>Music</h3>
					<p>
						Music is something that grew on me the more I was exposed to it and the older I got. When I used
						to
						live in
						Michigan the only thing I would ever
						listen to was hip hop and while that still is my favorite genre,
						moving to Northwest Ohio exposed me to many other music genres that I also enjoy a lot.
						I think music can be used to express yourself in a way that isn't possible in other forms of
						media.
						If I were to develop an indie game,
						I would also try to compose the music for it. I would aim to create a soundtrack that contains a
						lot
						of atmosphere and can be worth listening to on its own merits.
						This soundtrack would likely be inspired by the original sound tracks for Risk of Rain 2 and
						Persona
						5 because I think they both excel at these two things.
